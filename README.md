# pyebur128
A Cython implementation of the libeur128 library for audio loudness in media files.

## Installation

Working on getting wheels created/published, but for now you can easily run the following to get going:

```
python3 -m build
pip install dist/pyebur128*.whl
```

## TODO
1. Make a better README.md
2. Create the docs and upload them
3. Publish to PyPI
